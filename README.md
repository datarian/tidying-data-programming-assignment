# tidying-data-programming-assignment

## Overview
This repository contains an assignment that is part of the Data Science specialisation by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

## Folder structure
Input data as well as the resulting tidy dataset can be found in the folder `data/`.

## Running the code
The script `run_analysis.R` will load data and tidy it up. It concludes by saving the tidy data to `data/activity_mean_sensor_values.csv`. If data is drawn in from another folder outside this repo's clone, the directory path can be adjusted in the top part of the script.

Documentation of the code can be found directly inside the R script.
